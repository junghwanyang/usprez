This is a project to classify Twitter users by their political ideology.

Notes:
Raw data is in .txt format.
.sav data converted from the raw data are sorted by time and compressed.
Since the raw data contains the whole one day of tweets, I subsetted the data (i.e., during and two hours after the debates).
